# LetsEat

### By: Ben Schwartz

LetsEat is a sample Swift iOS app that allows users to view and book restaurants based on their location and food category preferences. This app is useful for people who want to discover new restaurants and easily make reservations. 

The app features filtering options for food category and location, allowing users to quickly find restaurants that match their preferences. 

Please note that this project was created some time ago and may require some work to get running locally. This repository contains the main branch which is the latest version of the code. To use LetsEat, please clone the repository and run the app in Xcode.
